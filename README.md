# Monthly Expenses Tracker

Monthly Expenses Tracker allows anyone to track and manage their monthly bills and quickly see how much they are spending every month. This app also allows anyone to see how much they have left over after all their bills are paid.

# Why did I create this?

I created this app as a side project to enhance my current understanding of Vanilla Javascript and MongoDB. This is in no way intended to be hosted and used as an actual service. I simply used this to get feedback on the code and improve my code understanding.

# Tech used in this project

-   Backend: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

-   Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript
